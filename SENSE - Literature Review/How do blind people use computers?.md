## Born Blind vs Became Blind

People who are born blind show stark differences in their understanding of visual contexts, as such creation of auditory (or otherwise) analogies must take into account this diversity in experiences.

### Partial Blindness or Legal Blindness

Some people who are legally blind but not `totally` blind prefer to use features such as `zoom` and `highcontrast` rather than screen-readers. [yt source](https://youtu.be/ylrlPX-4XMg?feature=shared&t=69)

Can we afford to exclude such individuals in our study? #open-question

### Some Definitions [yt source](https://youtu.be/hBoeoIqtI1I?feature=shared&t=164)

- **Visual Impairement**: Anything that affects vision from near-sightedness to astigmatism
- **Visually Impaired**: Anyting that corrective lenses (& stuff) can't fix
- **Legally Blind**: When the government decides you can't see (enough)
- **Fully Blind**: self-explanatory

### Most used tech

- Headphones (for screen-readers)
- Screen-reader
	- Voice-over (?)
- Braille display [yt source](https://youtube.com/shorts/qLVwFU5OpgE?feature=shared)

### Underrepresented tech

- Haptics
- Voice Assistants (?)

# Conclusion & Thoughts

- There is a distinct lack of any haptics or haptic technologies in accesibility settings. The users have not shown any desire to have it implemented either.
- Lack of good haptic hardware
- fast and quiet screen-readers are not a super-power (as previously thought) but very common among blind people
